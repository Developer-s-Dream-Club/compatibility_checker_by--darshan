# Compatibility Checker
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
To work out the love score between two people:
Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
For Love Scores less than 1 or greater than 9, the message should be:
# "Your score is x, you go together like coke and mentos."
For Love Scores between 4 and 5, the message should be:
# "Your score is y, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.
# "Your score is z."
